<h2>ALL IN PLAY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Editor,</span>&mdash;Whilst you were feasting in Burlington House amongst
the Pictures and the Royal Academicians, I was seated in the Stalls of
the St. James's Theatre, lost in astonishment (certainly not in
admiration, although of old the two words had the same meaning), at the
antics of a minority of the Gallery, who amused themselves by shouting
themselves hoarse before the performances commenced; but not satisfied
with this, they continued their shrieking further: they howled at the
overture of the first piece, they jeered at the scene, they yelled at
the actors. However, as it happened, <i>The Tiger</i> had been already
successfully played on two occasions last year, so a verdict was not
required at <i>their</i> hands. Had Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, the composer, conducted, he
would have taken <i>The Tiger</i> away, and left the howlers to their
howling. Since Saturday the piece has, I am informed, "gone" with what
the Americans call a "snap." The music is charming. Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Colnaghi</span>
made his bow as a professional, and played and sang excellently, as did
also Mr. <span class="smcap">J. G. Taylor</span>, in spite of the riotous conduct of the
"unfriendlies."</p>

<p>Then came <i>Esther Sandraz</i>. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Langtry</span> looked lovely, and played with
great power; but what an unpleasant part! Until the end of the First Act
all was right. The sympathy was with the heroine of the hour, or,
rather, two hours and a half; but when it was discovered that <i>Esther</i>
loved but for revenge, and wished to bring sorrow and shame upon the
fair head of Miss <span class="smcap">Marion Lea</span>, then the sentiments of the audience
underwent a rapid change. Everyone would have been pleased if Mr. <span class="smcap">Sugden</span>
had shot himself in Act II.; nay, some of us would not have complained
if he had died in Act I., but the cat-and-mouse-like torture inflicted
upon him by <i>Esther</i> was the reverse of agreeable. Mr. <span class="smcap">Sugden</span> was only a
"Johnnie," but still "Johnnies" have feelings like the rest of us. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bourchier</span> was rather hard as a good young man who does <i>not</i> die, and
Mr. <span class="smcap">Everill</span> (steady old stager) kept everything well together. If the
play keeps the boards for any length of time, it will be, thanks to the
power of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Langtry</span>, the natural pathos of Miss <span class="smcap">Marion Lea</span>, and the
unforced comedy of Mr. <span class="smcap">Everill</span>.</p>

<p>On Monday Miss <span class="smcap">Grace Hawthorne</span> produced <i>Theodora</i> at the Princess's
Theatre with some success. It cannot be said, however, that Mlle. <span class="smcap">Sara
Bernhardt</span> has at length found her rival, but, for all that, the heroine
of the moment might have been worse. "<span class="smcap">Sardou's</span> masterpiece" (as the
programmes have it) was very well staged. The scenery and costumes were
excellent, and great relief was afforded to the more tragic tones of the
play by entrusting the heavy part of <i>Andreas</i> to Mr. <span class="smcap">Leonard Boyne</span>, who
is a thorough artist, with just the least taste in life of the brogue
that savours more of the Milesian Drama. Mr. <span class="smcap">W. H. Vernon</span> was the
<i>Justinian</i> of the evening, and looked the Lawgiver to the life;
although I am not quite sure whether a half-concealed moustache was
quite the fashion in the days of the Empire. Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert Buchanan</span>, the
adapter of "the masterpiece," introduced several nineteenth century
expressions into the dialogue. In the "home of the Gladiators," it was
quite pleasant to hear people talking of a "row," and made one wish to
have a description of "a merry little mill," in the language of the
sporting Press. No doubt, the length of the performances was the reason
why so racy a narrative was omitted. For the rest, there are some thirty
speaking parts&mdash;a good allowance for a play consisting of six Acts and
seven <i>Tableaux</i>. A "Masterpiece" (in English) is better than a feast,
for it is enough&mdash;for a lifetime. Believe me,</p>

<p class="regards">yours faithfully,</p>

<h2>IN THE KNOW.</h2>

<center>(By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)</center>

<p><span class="smcap">Cardinal Richelieu</span> once observed to Madame <span class="smcap">de St. Galmier</span>, that if Kings
could but know the folly of their subjects they would hesitate at
nothing. Mr. <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> evidently knows thoroughly how stupendously
cabbage-headed his readers are, for he never hesitates to put forward
the most astounding and muddy-minded theories. For instance, he asks us
this week to believe that <i>Saladin</i> ought to have won the Shropshire
Handicap, because he was known to be a better horse, from two miles up
to fifty, than the four other horses who faced the starter. If this
stuff had been addressed to an audience of moon-calves and mock-turtles
it might have passed muster, but, thank Heaven, we are not <i>all</i> quite
so low as that yet. Let me therefore tell Mr. <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>, that when a horse
like <i>Saladin</i>, whose back-bone is like the Himalaya mountains, and his
pastern joints like a bottle-nosed whale with a cold in his head, comes
to the post with two stone and a beating to his credit, and four hoofs
about the size of a soup-tureen to his legs, he can never be <i>expected</i>
to get the better of slow roarers like <i>Carmichael</i> and <i>Busby</i>, to say
nothing of <i>Whatnot</i> and <i>Pumblechook</i>. It is well known, of course,
that the latter has been in hard training for a month, and a better
horse at cornbin or bran-mash never stepped. <i>Saladin</i> won, I know, but
it was for reasons very different from those given by Mr. <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>

<p>There is nothing new about the Derby horses. I believe they are mostly
in training, but I reserve my opinion until I see what the addle-pates
who own them mean to do.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">A self-made Man</span>," said Mrs. R., thoughtfully, "is the artichoke of his
own fortunes."</p>

<h4>THE MODERN HERCULES AND THE PYGMIES.</h4>

<center>(<i>Extracts from the Diary of an Explorer in the Society Islands.</i>)</center>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%">
<a href="images/230.png">
<img src="images/230.png" width="100%" alt="THE MODERN HERCULES AND THE PYGMIES" /></a>
</div>

<p>From the bears, apes, and foxes with which the thickets of the great
forest of Societas abounded, it is but a step to the Pygmy tribes whom
we found inhabiting the tract of country between the Uperten and the
Suburban rivers. The Pygmies are as old as Swelldom, as ubiquitous as
Boredom, the two secular pests of the earth. You will remember that
Hercules once fell asleep in the deserts of Africa, after his conquest
of Ant&aelig;us, and was disturbed in his well-earned rest by an attack of a
large army of these troublesome Lilliputians, who, it is recorded,
"discharged their arrows with great fury upon his arms and legs." The
hero, it is added, "pleased with their courage, wrapped a great number
of them in the skin of the Nemean lion, and carried them to Eurystheus."</p>

<p>I was not "pleased with their courage," but plagued with their
importunities. <span class="smcap">Herodotus</span> described the capture of five young explorers
from Naasamoves while they were examining some curious trees in the
Niger basin, and tells how the little men took them to their villages
and showed them about to their fellow Pygmies. So,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> in a sense, the
Pygmies of Societas "captured" me, and showed me about to their fellow
denizens of this Land of Lilliput. They "discharged their arrows" (which
they called "In-Vites," and each of which was branded with the mystic
letters, R.S.V.P.) at me in swarms, and though they rather tickled than
hurt, yet after a time their minute but multiplied prickings became no
end of a nuisance.</p>

<p>Let us pause a little, and pay such honour as is due for persistence and
importunity to these "little people," who have outlived the wise men of
Egypt, the prophets of Palestine, the magicians of Persia, and the sages
of Greece and Rome. They have actually been able to hold their own from
the days of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>, through those of <span class="smcap">Horace</span>, down even to those of
<span class="smcap">Haggard</span>. I have seen the wear and tear of the Pyramids of Egypt (which
is nothing to that of a lionised hero in Societas); I can certify that
the Sphynx presents a very battered appearance indeed (though not so
battered as mine, after the "little people" had done with me), but the
Pygmies of to-day in Societas appear to be as plentiful and as perky as
those that thousands of years ago swarmed in &AElig;thiopia, built their
houses with egg-shells, made war upon the Cranes, and attacked the tired
hero Hercules.</p>

<p>You will understand that I, who have always professed to love humanity,
even in the form of mannikins, better than beetles and butterflies, was
as much interested in these small creatures as was Hercules in the
skinful of midgets he carried to the exacting Eurystheus. As I looked at
them, and thought how these represented the oldest race on the
globe&mdash;namely, the Inquisitive Quidnuncs&mdash;my admiration really went to
greater lengths than scoffing cynics might have expected.</p>

<p>These Pygmies of Societas, though small, are cunning, and wise in their
generation. For the most part they toil not, (save at pleasure-seeking
and lion-hunting), neither do they spin (anything beyond the edifying
yarns they call "after-dinner stories"). But they manage to live on the
fat of the land. The larger aborigines (called the Whirkirs) are very
industrious, and form the clearings and cultivate the various produce of
the place. The Pygmies appear to be aware that the plantations and
powers of the Whirkirs are practically inexhaustible, and to think that
they have as much right to the produce as the aboriginal owners and
tillers. Therefore, they cling tightly to these plantations, and make
the larger and more laborious natives pay dearly for the honour of their
acquaintance. In another manner they perform valuable service by setting
fashions, receiving strangers, and assisting in the defence of the
settlements; they also hunt game, and supply the larger natives with
plenty to do in working for and waiting on them. It appeared to me that
the Pygmies were regarded somewhat as parasites (though highly
ornamental ones, like orchids) whose departure would be more welcome&mdash;to
the aborigines&mdash;than their vicinity. But a race which has survived so
much and so many things is not easily to be got rid of.</p>

<p>Anyhow, <i>I</i> couldn't get rid of them, though sometimes I felt inclined
to imitate Hercules. With their arrows and their unblushing
importunities they had me at advantage, and even as <i>Gulliver</i> became
the victim of the midgets of Lilliput, so did I of the innumerable,
inquisitive, imperturbably impertinent Pygmies of Societas.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Read</span> "As Haggards on the Rock" in <i>Scribner's</i> for May. It is a weird
tale, but nothing whatever to do with "<span class="smcap">Haggard</span>" ("<span class="smcap">Rider</span>" of that ilk),
which may or may not be an additional attraction, according to the taste
and fancy of the reader. "Never do I see <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>," quoth
the Baron, "without wishing to change its name, or start a competitor
under the style and title of '<i>Scribbler's Magazine</i>.' If the latter
isn't 'a colourable imitation,' it must be done, and that speedily."</p>

<p><i>Woman</i>, though appearing weekly, comes out peculiarly strong. "A really
entertaining, interesting, and chatty publication," says the Baroness.</p>

<p>One of the best volumes of the Badminton Library series is that on Golf,
recently published, written chiefly by <span class="smcap">Horace G. Hutchinson</span>, with
capital contributions on the subject from the great ruler of
Home-Rulers, <span class="smcap">Arthur Balfour</span>, M.P., and the ubiquitous and universally
gifted <span class="smcap">Merry Andrew Lang</span>, to whom no subject, apparently, presents any
difficulty whatever, he being, like Father <span class="smcap">O'Flynn</span>, able to discourse on
Theology or Conchology, or Mythology, and all the other ologies,
including, in this instance, Golfology, with equal skill and profundity
of wisdom. <i>Nihil tetigit quod non ornavit</i>, and the scent of the <span class="smcap">Lang y
Lang</span>, is over all periodical literature generally. Let not the elderly
intending student of Golf, on opening the book, be deterred by seeing a

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</center>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 5.</i>&mdash;Next year is my Jubilee&mdash;mine and
<i>Mr. Punch's</i>. Pup and dog, have known House of Commons for nigh fifty
years. Of course not so intimately as within the last eight or nine
years; but ever since I took my seat on piles of bound volumes at feet
of the <span class="smcap">Master</span>, have kept one eye on Parliament.</p>

<p>Never saw a scene to equal what took place to-night. When House met,
good deal of talk about yesterday's Labour Demonstration. Everybody
agreed it was enormous, unprecedented, momentous. The Working Man
demands a day of eight hours' labour, and will see that he gets it.
Still talking about the matter in whispers. Second Heading of Budget
Bill under discussion; <span class="smcap">Shaw-Lefevre</span> on legs, protesting against
increased expenditure on Army and Navy. Undertakes to show it is
absolutely unnecessary. Beginning his demonstration when hand of clock
touched hour of Six. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> rose with cry of "Order! Order!"
<span class="smcap">Shaw-Lefevre</span> resumed seat; afraid he had, in exuberance of eloquence,
committed some breach of order. Members crowded in to hear what <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>
had to say.</p>

<p>"This House," he said, as soon as silence restored, "will now adjourn.
At least I must withdraw; and unless it can be shown that Deputy-Speaker
has been in bed all day, or otherwise idling his time, you cannot go on.
Under ordinary circumstances, House meeting at Three o'clock, we should
have adjourned sharp at Eleven to-night; but the fact is, my day's work
began at Ten this morning. That is a necessity of my position. With
interval of hasty meals, I have been accustomed to work a maximum of
twelve hours a day, often running up to fourteen. That, however, now
over. Settled by Working Man that Labour Day should not exceed Eight
Hours. We will, therefore, now break up. I daresay some of you Hon.
Gentlemen, engaged at the Bar or in affairs in the City, commenced your
work even earlier than Ten?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>, "I do not know whether I am in order in
speaking after the clock has struck Six, and so extending our legal day.
I will, however, promise to be brief. In fact, I rise merely to confirm
your view, Sir, of our position. For my own part, I have been closely
engaged in the business that pertains to performance of my duty to the
<span class="smcap">Queen</span> and Country, since an hour earlier than Ten this morning, and I
think I may say the same for my friends near me on this Bench.
[<span class="smcap">Ashmead-Bartlett</span>: "Hear, hear!"] We were, as usual, prepared to go
forward with our work, to sit here till whatever hour was necessary to
accomplish it. Without abating one jit or tottle&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir William Harcourt</span>: "The Right Hon. Gentleman probably means one jot
or tittle."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>: "In accordance with my habit, Sir, I meant what I said. As
I was saying, when perhaps somewhat unnecessarily interrupted by the
Right Hon. Gentleman, I do not abate one tit or jottle of my desire to
perform my duty where duty is doo; but since our friend the Working Man
has declared in favour of a labouring day confined to Eight Hours, we
must needs follow him."</p>

<h4>Bolton bolting.</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> packed up his papers; <span class="smcap">Jokim</span> locked up red box containing
papers relating to Budget Scheme; <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> rose to continue discussion;
discovered that <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> had gone, and Serjeant-at-Arms removed Mace; so,
at few minutes past Six, got off with plenty of time to enjoy that
recreation, and cultivate those family relations, not less dear to a
Member of Parliament than to the more 'orny 'anded son of toil. Odd at
this early hour to hear cry of Doorkeeper, "Who goes home?"</p>

<p>"Well," says Member for St. Pancras, "I think <i>I'll</i> be <span class="smcap">Bolton</span>." And he
bolted. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;- New Eight Hours' Day arrangement came into
operation. Entirely successful.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ritchie</span> a mild-mannered man, six feet high, and of genial
temperament. But there are some things he can't stand. One is, to assume
that Government Bill dealing with Local Taxation involves Compensation
for disestablished publicans.</p>

<p>"I must say," he observed, just now, glaring on <span class="smcap">Caleb Wright</span>, "that I
object to the word Compensation which the Hon. Gentleman has used in his
question."</p>

<p>What Government had done was to propose measure for the extinction of
licences. Of course, a little money would pass. <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>, in Budget Scheme,
made provision to enable County Council to buy out publicans. "But to
call such a transaction Compensation is," <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span> added, his left eye
twitching in fearsome manner on <span class="smcap">Caleb Wright</span>, "preposterous."</p>

<p>That being so, House went into Committee on Allotments Bill, and drummed
away till sitting suspended.</p>

<p>At Evening Sitting, <span class="smcap">Bob Reid</span> brought on Motion raising sort of British
Land Question. Wants to empower Town Councils and County Councils in
England and Scotland to acquire, either by agreement or compulsorily,
such land within their district as may be needed for the requirements of
the inhabitants. House naturally shocked to find a Member proposing to
discuss any phase of Land Question apart from Ireland. Interposition of
Great Britain in this connection regarded as impertinence. Compromise
arrived at; agreed to leave out Scotland. On these terms Debate went
forward.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> in charge of case for Government. At last, in his natural
position, temporary Leader of the House.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> (<i>aside</i>), "Glamis and Thane of Cawdor! the greatest is behind."</p>

<p>How different from ancient days and nights, when he sat below Gangway in
corner seat, that is, when he could get it. Couldn't always; sometimes
presumptuous person forestalled him. Even when there, with notes of
treasured speech in swelling breast pocket, by no means certain he would
find opportunity of convincing House. Others step in, and edge him on
into ignominious dinner hour. Now a Minister of the Crown, with a new
Department created for his control; to-night in charge of Government
business. <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> off early, full of restful confidence.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Chaplin's</span> looking after things," he said, as he made himself
comfortable in his room. "Needn't bother; all will go right. Great thing
for a First Minister to have a man he can thoroughly depend on."</p>

<p>"At least, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> said, "those were his remarks as reported to
me. I will not deny that they are gratifying."</p>

<p>At the proper time&mdash;at his own time&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture rose,
and, positively pervading the premises, utterly demolished <span class="smcap">Bob Reid</span>, his
supporters, his arguments, and his resolution.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Chaplin</span>," said <span class="smcap">John Morley</span>, watching him with admiring glance, "always
reminds me of <span class="smcap">Victor Hugo's</span> description of the <i>Rev. Ebenezer Caudray</i>.
You remember him in <i>Les Travailleurs de la Mer</i>? Haven't the book with
me, but translation runs something like this:&mdash;'He had the gracefulness
of a page, mingled with the dignity of a Bishop.' Never knew that <span class="smcap">Victor
Hugo</span> was personally acquainted with <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span>; but he certainly here hits
off his characteristics in a phrase."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Miscellaneous, and not much.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"Where do you put the Cow?"</p>

<p>"Was ever man interrupted with such a question in such circumstances?"
asked <span class="smcap">Jesse Collings</span>, unconsciously quoting <i>Tristram Shandy's</i> father.</p>

<p>Circumstances sufficiently strange to make a man quote <span class="smcap">Sterne</span>, even if
he'd never read his masterpiece. House in Committee on Budget Bill.
<span class="smcap">Storey</span> moved Amendment on Clause 26, dealing with exemption from
Inhabited House Duty of tenement buildings. <span class="smcap">Chancellor</span> of the <span class="smcap">Exchequer</span>
taken part in the Debate. <span class="smcap">Charles Russell</span> said a few words. House in
most serious, not to say depressed mood. Subject particularly inviting
for <span class="smcap">Jesse</span>; always advocated welfare of Working Classes; now seized
opportunity to descant on theme. Detailed with growing warmth
arrangements desirable for perfecting sanitation of houses for Working
Classes; when <span class="smcap">Tanner</span>, crossing arms and legs, and cocking head on one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
side, with provoking appearance of keen interest, suddenly submitted
this problem:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where do you put the Cow?"</p>

<p>Opposition laughed. Ministerialists cried, "Order!" Various courses open
to <span class="smcap">Jesse</span>. Might have assumed air of interested inquiry. Cow? What Cow?
Why drag in the Cow? Might have slain <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> with a stony stare, and
left him to drag his untimely quadruped off the ground. But <span class="smcap">Jesse</span> took
the Cow seriously. Allowed it to get its horns entangled amid thread of
his argument. Glared angrily upon the pachydermatous <span class="smcap">Tanner</span>, and having
thus played into his hands, loftily declared, "I do not propose to take
any notice of the insult."</p>

<p>"It makes me smile," said <span class="smcap">Swift MacNeill</span>, walking out for fear <span class="smcap">Goschen</span>
should hear his smile and clap a penny on his Income-Tax.</p>

<p>A long night for <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>, wrestling for his Budget. Ominous gathering on
Front Bench. Mr. G., not seen lately, comes down. To him foregathers
<span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>. Assaults on Budget begun from below the Gangway. Proposed to
postpone clauses on which Local Budget Bill will be built up. <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>
shakes his head. Mr. G. amazed at his refusal to listen to reasonable
suggestion. <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> rises, meaning to run atilt at <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>. Chairman of
Committees puts out his foot, nearly trips him up. <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> turns and
bends on <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> expressive glance. Never much love lost between these
two. Now <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> in official position can snub <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>&mdash;and does.
Shall <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> go for him? Shall he take him up in his powerful arms and
tear him to pieces with delighted teeth? A moment's pause, whilst
<span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, towering at table, toying nervously with eyeglass, looks down
on Chairman who has just ruled him out of order. Shall he? Struggles
with his suddenly awakened wrath, gulps it down, turns aside to talk of
something else.</p>

<p>Not to-night, but some night there will be wigs (especially <span class="smcap">Courtney's</span>)
on the green.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget in Committee.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Met <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> walking with weary footsteps from Lords.
Curiously depressed air. "Anything happened at East Bristol?" I asked.
"But you cannot have heard yet."</p>

<p>"No; nothing to do with bye-elections," said the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>, with sob in
his throat. "It's <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span>; touched me to the quick; was to have made
speech to-night on Socialistic legislation of last two years. Hadn't
slightest idea what he meant. Came down to-night a little late; found
House up. <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span> wouldn't deliver his speech in my absence; thing didn't
come off; so Lords went home. That's what I call personal devotion.
Supposed to be hard cynical man, but you see I have my soft places, and
<span class="smcap">Wemyss</span> has touched me."</p>

<p>Not a dry eye between us as the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> moved off.</p>

<h2>TWO VIEWS OF THE SODGERIES.</h2>

<center><span class="smcap">No. I. By a Gentleman who got a Bad Seat at the Inauguration.</span></center>

<p>It seems rather a high-handed proceeding to deprive the inhabitants of
South Belgravia, Old Chelsea, Pimlico and Battersea, of about half of
their recreation grounds. This certainly has been done to find a site
for the Sodgeries. Whether the Sodgeries will be worth the trouble is
another matter. It may be as well to glance hurriedly at its contents.</p>

<p>Certainly, very hurriedly, when one comes to the Ambulance Department. A
most ghastly show! Lay-figures reclining in the most realistic fashion
on a field of battle, with surgeons and vultures(!) in attendance. If
anything could choke off an intending recruit, it would be this. I
consider the display as inimical to the best interests of the Army.</p>

<p>Then the Battle Gallery? Can anything be less interesting? Here and
there the portrait of a General! But such portraits! One veteran warrior
is actually shown in the act of playing upon a fiddle! As for the
pictures of the victories, there is scarcely anything new worth looking
at. Same good old Inkermann, by Lady <span class="smcap">Butler</span>, as of yore; and the same
good old recollections of Egypt from past Academies. For the rest, the
room contains some comfortable chairs. They are more inviting than the
relics! Then the remainder of the Exhibition! Well, the advertisers have
their share, and the restaurant people are all over the place. There are
some figures sent over by nigger chieftains, and a little armour.
Finally, the grounds are imperfectly illuminated at night with paper
lanterns and the electric light. Plenty of military music for those who
like it, but who does?</p>

<p>The arrangements for the comfort of the Press at the opening ceremony
(when I was present) were unsatisfactory. But this is a detail.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">No. II. By a Gentleman who got a good Seat at the Inauguration.</span></center>

<p>Nothing could have been more judicious than to enclose some of the
grounds of Chelsea Hospital for the holding of that excellent exhibition
known as "The Sodgeries." The inhabitants of South Belgravia, Old
Chelsea, Pimlico, and Battersea must bless the Authorities for their
kindness in selecting a site so close to their doors. That the
Exhibition may be properly appreciated, it may be worth while to glance
hurriedly at its contents. A difficult matter to hurry when one comes to
the Ambulance Department. A most interesting display. Here we have the
battle-field capitally painted, and illustrating how our doctors and
nurses do their good work. If anything could confirm an intending
recruit to take the Queen's Shilling, it would be this <i>tableau</i>, so
suggestive of succour to the wounded. I consider the display decidedly
in the best interests of the Army.</p>

<p>Then the Battle Gallery! Can anything be more interesting? Numerous
portraits of Generals&mdash;not only in full uniform, but as they are to be
seen at home in the bosoms of their families. Every picture of a victory
is full of interest, and the relics are priceless. One case contains the
identical cloak worn by the great Duke at Waterloo, and another the
celebrated panorama of his funeral. The latter, I fancy, was drawn by
that well-known artist, who signs himself, when he drops into
literature, "G. A. S." If I am right in my conjecture, I may add that I
believe all the numberless figures in the admirable composition are
wearing Wellington boots. For the rest, the room contains comfortable
chairs, but who cares for chairs when such relics are on view!</p>

<p>Then the remainder of the Exhibition! It would take pages to catalogue
its hundreds of interesting exhibits. Arms, figures, manufactures,
musical instruments. What not? And the grounds! At night a perfect
fairy-land, beautifully illuminated with hundreds of gleaming lanterns,
and the electric light. Finally the best military music in the world,
for those who like it, and who does not?</p>

<p>The arrangements for the comfort of the Press at the opening ceremony
(when I was present) were satisfactory to the last degree. But this is a
detail.</p>

<p>Lady <span class="smcap">Henrietta Shimmers'</span> long-talked-of Dance came off yesterday
evening, at her <i>recherch&eacute;</i> little mansion in North-west Bayswater, and
was a great success. A handsome second-hand slip of Dutch carpet was
laid down on the pavement outside the Hall-door, and from an early hour
in the afternoon afforded a theme for much favourable comment in the
immediate neighbourhood. The staircase had been, with the aid of
half-a-dozen night-lights and a profusion of homemade paper flowers,
turned into a perfect fairyland, the illusion becoming the more perfect
the further the spectator receded. The one purple and green Hungarian,
who attended with his trombone to represent that celebrated band of
musicians, supplied the dance music with much spirit, while those noted
<i>viveurs</i>, capable of expressing an opinion on the subject of supper,
declare that the South-American tinned oysters, and the
seventeen-shilling Roumanian champagne, with which they washed them
down, were both, in their way, respectively, in the shape of
refreshment, quite the most remarkable things they had met with anywhere
this season. The company was select and distinguished. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jippling</span>,
who brought her two chubby-faced, pretty daughters, both in
ditch-water-coloured cotton, was a simple blaze of Birmingham paste and
green-glass emeralds, and with her <i>pompadour</i> of yellow satin bed
curtain, trimmed with <i>chiffons</i> of scarlet bell-ropes, looped up
tastefully with bunches of <i>cordons d'onions d'Espagne &agrave; la
blanchisseuse</i>, was the centre of pleasurable astonishment wherever she
went. <span class="smcap">Lady Pickover</span> also created quite a sensation, being a perfect
dream in orange worsted. Miss <span class="smcap">Mugallow</span> attracted a good deal of notice,
wearing the celebrated heavily enamelled plated family Holly-hocks, and
several <i>d&eacute;butantes</i> in bright arsenical Emerald Green, who had not much
to recommend them in the way of good looks, came in for a fair amount of
cynically disagreeable comment. The dance terminated at an early hour in
the morning, it being eventually brought to a conclusion by a little
riot in the hall, caused by the linkman (who, owing to his potations,
had not been very steady after midnight) endeavouring to make off with
the hat-and-umbrella-stand, a feat which brought the police on to the
premises with a suggestion, that "as things seemed getting a bit lively
inside, perhaps the concern had better come to a finish." The
proceedings shortly after this, were brought to an abrupt conclusion.</p>

<p>Two young men of aristocratic appearance, and otherwise faultless dress,
were observed in the Park on Monday, in boots of ordinary leather. This
breach of the <i>convenances</i> has excited much comment in the fashionable
world to which they belong.</p>

<hr />

<p>A curious sight was yesterday witnessed in Piccadilly. A gentleman well
known in Society and in Politics lost his hat, which was run over, but
not otherwise damaged, by a passing omnibus. The Honourable Gentleman's
exclamation has been the subject of considerable remark in the Lobby of
the House.</p>

<hr />

<p>A careful investigator has been occupied in calculating the amount of
roof accommodation available for the cats of the Metropolis. Dividing
London according to Parliamentary districts, and subdividing these
parochially and by streets (due allowance being, of course, made for
wear and tear and removals), he has reached the remarkable conclusion,
that every cat can command exactly one two-hundredth part of a roof. In
this calculation kittens have been neglected.</p>

<hr />

<p>What is this I hear about the Officers of the Sheriff of a County not a
hundred miles from the Metropolis, refusing to be present at Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leo
Hunter's</span> grand reception in Lower Chelsea, to meet the youngest son of
His Highness the Rajah of Jamjam, <span class="smcap">Alikhan Indoore</span>? Was it because Mrs.
H. forgot to ask their wives?</p>

<hr />

<p>The great feature of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Duit Cheepeley's</span> Fancy Dress Pic-nic at
Burnham Beeches will be, that every guest will bring his own hamper. The
hostess herself, as Ceres, the Goddess of Plenty, will provide the
corkscrews only.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Contre Jumpere</span>, of the 28th Volunteer Battalion of the
Diddlesex Regiment (Shoreditch Sharpshooters), on Saturday last
entertained the officers under his command at a <i>d&eacute;jeuner &agrave; deux plats</i>
in the palatial restaurant of which he is Managing Director.</p>

<hr />

<p>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, and <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> have met Mr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> is
reported to have said that he will <i>not</i> meet them again.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the last moment it is reported that the engagement of the great
African Explorer with Mrs. <span class="smcap">Snookes</span> to meet at five o'clock tea Sir
<span class="smcap">Joseph</span> and Lady <span class="smcap">Smuggings</span> is indefinitely postponed.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Robert</span>" writes to us about "The Ewents of the Week." He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The City Acaddemy, which it's on the Tems Embankment, opened on
Toosday, and I'm told as about a thowsend pupils went a scrambling in
there, as hurly as 9 a clock, with their shiny morning faces, and with
their scratchels on their backs, as the Poet says, and with their
lunches in 'em, as praps the Poet didn't kno of; and arterwards, the
<span class="smcap">Lord Mare</span> and his Sherryffs went to Epping Forest and dined at a Pick
Nick with a lot of Werderers, whatever they may be, and some common
Counselmen, but, strange to say, they didn't have no Wenson! so they
made Game of one another. They didn't arsk that Mr. <span class="smcap">Percy Lindley</span>, who's
allers a finding fault with 'em for cutting so many trees down and then
cutting 'em up. They ort to have known from their long xperience, that a
jolly good dinner woud most likely have made him hopen his mouth, and
shut his eyes, and hold his Tung, like a gennelman."</p>

<p>"At a meeting at 'Good Old Bethnal Green,' as a werry lowd woiced
gennelman called it, it was enounced that Mr. <span class="smcap">Passmore Edwards</span>, the
howner of the howdacious hapenny 'Hecko,' had promised to give 'em
&pound;20,000 to bild 'em a new Library with! when the lowd woiced gennelman
ginerously enounced that he woud buy a coppy of that paper the werry
next day! If that isn't grattetude, what is?"</p>

<hr />

<p>A Cambridge Mathematician of repute has just concluded a careful and
exhaustive calculation, by which he maintains that if all the pork-chops
eaten in London in a week were placed in a row, they would reach from
Camberwell to the Isle of Wight; and if piled in a heap on each other,
would form a mound half as high again as Primrose Hill.</p>
